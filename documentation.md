## 1. Executive Summary & Product Vision

### What is KrishiClinic AI?
KrishiClinic AI is an intelligent, digital agricultural platform designed to diagnose crop diseases, provide actionable treatment recommendations, and connect smallholder farmers with certified agricultural experts. By combining high-speed AI computer vision with a "human-in-the-loop" verification workflow, the platform delivers immediate safety-first advice while ensuring clinical accuracy.

### The Problem
Smallholder farmers in India lose an estimated 30% to 35% of their annual crop yields to preventable pests, weeds, and pathogens. Traditional agricultural extension services are overburdened, and getting a physical visit from a certified agronomist can take days or weeks—during which entire crops can be ruined.

### The Solution
KrishiClinic AI resolves this gap:
- **Instant AI Diagnosis**: Farmers snap a photo of a diseased leaf and receive an immediate, high-probability analysis.
- **Expert Review Loop**: AI diagnoses are automatically routed to a console for agronomists to audit.
- **Safety First**: Raw AI advice is masked for farmers under a "Pending Review" status to avoid the application of incorrect chemicals. Once an agronomist verifies it, the advice is unlocked.
- **Recovery Tracking**: Farmers take follow-up photos to monitor crop healing progress.

## 2. The Core User Journey (How It Works)

The product is built around a simple, sequential five-step workflow:

```
[ Farmer Upload ]  [ AI Analysis & RAG Search ]  [ Pending Review (Masked) ]  [ Agronomist Verification ]  [ Verified Advisory Unlocked ]
```

1.  **Farmer Uploads Query**: The farmer snaps a photo of their diseased crop, selects the crop type, notes any observed symptoms (e.g., "yellow spots on lower leaves"), and specifies their regional location.
2.  **AI & RAG Analysis**: The system immediately analyzes the image and uses text embeddings to search historical cases for similar symptoms verified by experts (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
3.  **Graceful Degradation (Safety Gate)**: While the AI works, the query goes into the `PENDING_REVIEW` state. Standard farmers are shown a "Pending Review" banner, protecting them from acting on potential AI hallucinations or errors.
4.  **Agronomist Review**: A certified agronomist logs into the console, reviews the raw AI recommendation side-by-side with the uploaded photo, overrides any mistakes, and inputs custom advisory notes.
5.  **Advisory Release**: The status transitions to `REVIEWED`. The farmer is notified, the verified advisory is unlocked in their native language, and they can download a printable PDF report.
6.  **Progress Tracking**: The farmer uploads a follow-up image weeks later to document the crop's recovery, building a historical "Before-and-After" case file.

## 5. Database Schema Design & Migrations

The predictions table utilizes UUID primary keys, TIMESTAMPTZ timestamps, and indexes on `created_at` and `predicted_disease` to optimize analytics dashboards performance.

## 6. Swappable AI Interface & Local PyTorch Inference

### Decoupled AI Architecture
AI operations are hidden behind the abstract `AIProvider` contract. Swapping providers requires updating the `AI_PROVIDER` environment variable, requiring **zero code modifications** in API routing or service layers.

### 5 swappable AI Engines
1.  **Mock Provider (`mock`)**: Returns deterministic response objects depending on crop parameters. No API keys needed; ideal for tests and dev runs.
2.  **Google Gemini (`gemini`)**: Connects to the `google-genai` SDK using `gemini-1.5-flash` or `gemini-2.0-flash`. Enforces structured JSON schema outputs.
3.  **Groq API (`groq`)**: Invokes Llama-3 models via Groq REST endpoints.
4.  **OpenAI SDK (`openai`)**: Integrates GPT-4o-mini structured schema APIs.
5.  **Local PyTorch (`local`)**: Edge inference using a fine-tuned **EfficientNetV2-S** model. Automatically caches model weights from the Hugging Face Hub, allowing completely offline local inference.

### Fallback Provider Wrapper
Includes a wrapper fallback provider. If Gemini or OpenAI fails (due to network error, invalid API key, or rate limits), the fallback wrapper catches the exception and degrades gracefully to Mock data. It saves `ai_provider: "gemini (fallback to mock)"` to the database, ensuring system availability.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Before querying LLMs, the service vectorizes the crop type and notes, searches the database for similar verified agronomist cases, and injects the top 2 matching case details directly into the LLM system prompt. This drastically improves diagnosis quality.

## 7. Advanced Application Features

### JWT Expert Review Workflow
- **Roles**: `FARMER`, `AGRONOMIST`, `ADMIN` (passwords hashed via bcrypt).
- **Masking**: Queries uploaded by farmers default to the `PENDING_REVIEW` state. Standard farmers receive a masked response ("Pending expert review") to avoid acting on inaccurate raw AI predictions.
- **Agronomist Portal**: Agronomists can log in, view raw AI data, verify the disease, customize recommendations, and confirm status as `REVIEWED`, unlocking the advisory.

### PDF Report Card Generation
Provides `GET /predictions/{id}/pdf` generating custom PDF advisory sheets using `ReportLab`, complete with crop metadata, comparison before-after photographs, and verified agronomist treatment details.

### Outbreak India Heatmap
Frontend features an interactive vector map of India's states utilizing the `@svg-maps/india` package. It dynamically reads location outbreaks from the analytics endpoint, highlighting state risk zones in red/green with smooth transitions.

## 8. Local Setup Instructions

### Docker Compose Quick-Start
To bring up Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, and PostgreSQL database with a single command:

1.  **Copy Environment File**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    *(Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` to run real models; otherwise it defaults to the mock fallback).*

2.  **Build and Start**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
    - **Backend API**: `http://localhost:8000`

Run the test suite:
```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
```

## 10. Engineering Decisions & Rationale

1.  **Layered Service Architecture**: Separated endpoints from business logic. Allows changing storage, AI models, and database components with zero impact on web routes.
2.  **Spooled File Uploads**: Used `UploadFile` spooled file descriptors instead of raw `bytes`. This streams uploads to temporary disk files, preventing Out-Of-Memory (OOM) failures under concurrent traffic.
3.  **Local Image Storage with Provider Abstraction**: Stored image files in the local container volumes using `secrets.token_hex(16)` filenames (prevents name collisions and path traversal attacks). Kept behind a `StorageProvider` ABC, making future S3/GCS integrations highly decoupled.
4.  **Alembic Database Versioning**: Avoided static SQL files by versioning SQL tables through Alembic migrations.

## 11. Reflection Questions

- **Hardest challenge**: Designing the swappable AI engine and Structured Outputs contract. Solved by defining standard Pydantic models for inputs and outputs, ensuring LLM engines return valid, parseable JSON via JSON schema configuration.
- **Biggest trade-off**: Storing crop images on the local disk instead of S3. Solved by placing storage behind an interface, allowing future AWS integrations to be completed with minimal code edits.
- **Biggest learning**: The elegance of FastAPI dependency injection (`Depends()`), which simplified injecting mock sessions, mock AI providers, and test storages during pytest suites.
